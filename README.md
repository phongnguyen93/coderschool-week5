## Topics: Strings and Arrays

* Arrays: ordered lists of items often used for sequential lists
* Strings: sequences of character data.

### Required tasks

**Strings**

- [x] Read String Questions in Interviews.
  - Strings are immutable. To reverse string, we need a temporary variable.
  - We can use recursion for permutation of a string.
  - The most common interview questions:
    + Generate all permutations of a given String
    + Substrings of a given String
    + Reversing a given String
    + Substitution/Replacing specific letters
    + String Compression
- [x] Watch [Memoization and Dynamic Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8Xa2BitN3I) video
  - Fibonaci function has big(O) = O(2^n).
  - Memorization can improve with big(O) = O(n)
  - Memorization is used to prevent duplicate calculation
- [x] Watch [Anagram Problem Solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MwRGPPB4tw) video
  - Strings are called anagrams if they are same letters and same counts but have different orders.

**Arrays**

- [ ] Read Sorting Algorithms
- [x] Watch [Introduction to Sorting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkkFqlG0Hds) video
  - Sort is improves the readability of that data, at others to be able to search or extract the data
- [x] Watch [Merge Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF2j-9iSf4Q) video
  - Merge sort using recusion.
**Coding**

- [x] Set up `exercism` and complete at least 2 exercises using `exercism submit`.

### Optional tasks

- [ ] Do more tasks on exercism
- [ ] Set up an account on Interviewbit.com and start the [Programming course](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/)
- [ ] Finish [Time Complexity chapter](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/time-complexity) in Level 1 of Interviewbit
- [ ] Finish [Arrays chapter]((https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/arrays/)) in Level 2 of Interviewbit
- [ ] Finish [Math chapter](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/math/) in Level 2 of Interviewbit.
